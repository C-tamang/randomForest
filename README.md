# Random Forest
I worked with the white wine quality dataset. Although the dataset already has wine quality values, I still used various features from the dataset to predict the quality of the wine. I ran the random forest algorithm, predicted the wine quality, and compared as well as visualized the model performance.
## Dataset
Dataset is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
